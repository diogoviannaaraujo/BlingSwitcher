### About

This is one of the first open source codes I've written in my life, i guess it was 2007. after long time found its code and a also lot of references to it on the internet, found out it has even been published to most linux distributions on the awn-extras packages.

Unfornately I was really young and din't provided any licence or answered any emails and it was removed after some time.

Keeping here for nostalgia.
